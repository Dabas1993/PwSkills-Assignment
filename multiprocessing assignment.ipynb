    "Q1. What is multiprocessing in python? Why is it useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans - \n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing in Python is a built-in package that allows the system to run multiple processes simultaneously. It will enable the breaking of applications into smaller threads that can run independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing can make a program substantially more efficient by running multiple tasks in parallel instead of sequentially. A similar term is multithreading, but they are different."

    "Q2. What are the differences between multiprocessing and multithreading?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans - \n",
    "In multithreading, multiple threads at the same time are generated by a single process. In multiprocessing, multiple threads at the same time run across multiple cores. Multithreading can not be classified. Multiprocessing can be classified such as symmetric or asymmetric.\n",
    "A process is a program loaded into memory to run and does not share its memory with other processes. A thread is an execution unit within a process. Multiple threads run in a process and share the processâ€™s memory space with each other.\n"
