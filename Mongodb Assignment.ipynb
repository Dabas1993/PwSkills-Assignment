    "MongoDB is a schema-less database, which means the database can manage data without the need for a blueprint. Document. Data in MongoDB is stored in documents with key-value pairs instead of rows and columns, which makes the data more flexible when compared to SQL databases.\n",
    "Non-relational databases are often used when large quantities of complex and diverse data need to be organized. For example, a large store might have a database in which each customer has their own document containing all of their information, from name and address to order history and credit card information.\n",
    "QL databases are used to store structured data while NoSQL databases like MongoDB are used to save unstructured data. MongoDB is used to save unstructured data in JSON format. MongoDB does not support advanced analytics and joins like SQL databases support."
