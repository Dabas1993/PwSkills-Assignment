    "Primary Key: - The primary key is a unique or non-null key that uniquely identifies every record in a table or relation. Each database needs a unique identifier for every row of a table, and the primary key plays a vital role in identifying rows in the table uniquely. The primary key column can't store duplicate values. It is also called a minimal super key; therefore, we cannot specify more than one primary key in any relationship\n",

    "Foreign Key: - The foreign key is a group of one or more columns in a database to uniquely identify another database record in some other table to maintain the referential integrity. It is also known as the referencing key that establishes a relationship between two different tables in a database. A foreign key always matches the primary key column in another table. It means a foreign key column in one table refers to the primary key column of another table. A foreign key is beneficial in relational database normalization, especially when we need to access records from other tables.\n",

    "The main difference between them is that the primary key identifies each record in the table, whereas the foreign key is used to link two tables together."
